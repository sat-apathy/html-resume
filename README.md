# HTML Resume

This is a simple resume webpage built using only **HTML**.

I created this project as part of the Web Dev Cohort 2026 assignment to practice writing clean and structured HTML without using CSS or JavaScript.  
The goal was to focus purely on semantic tags like headings, lists, tables, and sections.

## What’s inside

The page includes:

- Name and header
- About me section
- Skills list
- Experience table
- Projects / learning highlights
- Education details

- Contact information

Everything is built using plain HTML only.
