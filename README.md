# HTML Resume

This is a simple resume webpage built using only **HTML**.

I created this project as part of the **Web Dev Cohort 2026** assignment to practice writing clean, structured, and semantic HTML without using CSS or JavaScript.
The goal was to focus purely on HTML elements such as headings, lists, tables, and sections.
